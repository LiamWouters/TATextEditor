<mark>"Climatc</mark> change" and "global warming" are often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings. Similarly, the terms "weather" and "climate" are sometimes confused, though they refer to events with broadly different spatial- and timescales. Weather vs. climate. Weather refers to atmospheric conditions that occur locally over short periods of time, from minutes to hours or days. Familiar examples include rain, snow, <b>cumulus</b>, winds, floods or thunderstorms. Climate, on the other hand, refers to regional or even global average temperature over a certain period of time, humidity and rainfall patterns over seasons, years or decades. What is global warming? Global warming is the heating of the climate system of earth, observed since before the industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat, trapping greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere. The term is frequently used interchangeably with the term climate change, though the latter refers to both humanly and naturally produced warming and the effects it has on our planet. It is most commonly measured as the average increase in global surface temperature of earth. Since before the industrial period, human activities are estimated to have increased the global average temperature of the earth by about 1 degree celsius (1.8 degrees fahrenheit) , a number that is currently increasing by 0.2 degrees celsius (0.36 degrees fahrenheit) per decade. It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed
