This edge case is made to test the use of the dot. If a dot is behind a certain abbreviation such as " Dr. ", the dot should not
mark the end of the sentence. The way the system checks for these abbreviations is by creating and saving a DFA
(minimized for efficiency). Whenever a token contains a dot it will run this token through the DFA, if it is accepted
it would not end the sentence meaning that it is an abbreviation.
